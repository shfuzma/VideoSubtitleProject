1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,171
this is how to tie the Pratt knot in under a minute. We're going to be coming with the steam side pointing

3
00:00:06,171 --> 00:00:10,586
I got the smaller and on my right shoulder at my belly button

4
00:00:10,586 --> 00:00:12,705
beer and on my left shoulder

5
00:00:12,705 --> 00:00:18,181
I want to take the big ring just bring it into the center and then went across the smaller and over

6
00:00:18,181 --> 00:00:20,734
switch hands make it all easier

7
00:00:20,734 --> 00:00:23,553
taking the bigger and now I'm going to go down

8
00:00:23,553 --> 00:00:25,185
have something like that

9
00:00:25,185 --> 00:00:27,548
you're going to take it and go across

10
00:00:27,548 --> 00:00:29,262
you're going to bring it up

11
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:33,771
and you're going to finish by going down that cross we just made

12
00:00:33,771 --> 00:00:35,405
the Pratt knot
